#Â Severn Bronies development practices

This repo doesn't actually have any code in it. It's a place of us to store overarching documentation that span multiple projects. 

You can read how we do what we do [on the wiki](https://github.com/severnbronies/Development-Practices/wiki) or raise any questions you have [as an issue](https://github.com/severnbronies/Development-Practices/issues).
